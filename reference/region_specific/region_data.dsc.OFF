            description: "Song Tide’s the largest city and a hub of commerce for this area. Where is it located? Located in north central Song Tide. Home to sailors, fisherman, and a nascent shipbuilding industry. There is a disparity between the rich and poor. Magic is welcome here, but some industrialists are recently becoming skeptical of magery in favor of commerce. Located Northwest of Bardtown. Located West of Runesbrook. Located North of Buccaneers Den. Located East of Hawk Finster Hollow. Rothigport is the major market town in the northern Song Tide Archipelago  Though Song Tide itself is as old as the Age of Man, Rothigport was founded about 500 januul ago. It was built on water by people who saw the water as a defense and ally. Rothigport, being one of the first seafarering people in Deluvia, built the town out in the harbor so the warring kingdoms at the time had no successful way to raid this floating town. It was first a dock where fisherman would come to trade hooks, nets and other equipment in the northern harbor of Goylsmuth Bay. It slowly grew over the next few hundred years as each fisherman would build a new shanty next to the last and the town cobbled together more huts and storage for their fishing industry.  This village has grown into a small city with a trading network that is now vast in Song Tide. There are marauders and pirates who have also threatened the waters, but the pirates also do well with the trade of the town and play nice when they come to town most times. Rothigport is known as a pirate’s haven. The growth spurt of seedy taverns worries the old generation. For adventurers, they go to these locales to hear the stories and perhaps find where the next adventure awaits. There are many monsters who lurk in the archipelago but they keep to their own areas and rarely get close to Rothigport. The exception might be the kraken, Regnareeg, who frequents the waters just north of Rothigport.Because of the monsters, treasure and other adventures in Song Tide, many adventurers come to Rothigport to get provisions and hear the local rumors."
        bardtown:
            description: "The city of Harmony, it is located on the eastern side of The Song Tide and facing facing The Long Sea. Many famous bards and scribes live atop this hillside island town. Bardtown is a festive town which seems to have a party somewhere in the town every night. Often the amphitheatre is the center of activity, where people gather when there is not a performance. There is also a nice garden at the top tier where bards mingle with other socialites of the town. The Greater Songtide Symphony also performs here on a regular schedule, which  that includes members from many towns across the Song Tide and beyond. Krizzdo and is wonderwagon are often found outside the city limits on the beach as he is no longer allowed in town for the fires and havoc he’s caused. He comes back once a moontick or and some of the citizens that want to remain in contact will go down to see him. Bardtown is the City of Harmony. And the City of Sandstone. It seeks harmony and balance in all things. It wishes to keep all the elements of Deluvia in balance with each other and not let any virtue outweigh another. Bardtown is the second largest town in Song Tide and is considered the home of the bards. (although bards are in every town and in the countryside as well) It is spread across two islands Cantos and Westerisle and is a town of allure and festiveness, including the amphitheater where aspiring actors and musicians can perform. Some of the most prestigious Bards in Deluvia live here. They reside in their cottages to stay close to their fans and accolytes and get inspired writing and composing by the seaside and once in a while, performing at the famous amphitheatre."

                advanced: "Hidden within the folds of an ancient tapestry, hanging proudly upon the wall behind Risdoni's weathered counter, lies a cryptic clue to a long-forgotten secret. Woven with threads of celestial blue and shimmering silver, the tapestry depicts a celestial map of the night sky, its intricate patterns a testament to the craftsmanship of its maker. Amidst the twinkling stars and swirling nebulae, keen eyes may discern faintly engraved symbols, concealed within the tapestry's elaborate design. These symbols, though subtle, hold the key to unlocking a mystery—a clue to the whereabouts of a hidden chest, buried deep beneath the earth. To the untrained observer, the symbols may seem little more than decorative embellishments, lost amidst the celestial splendor. But to those with the wisdom to decipher their meaning, they reveal a hidden truth—a path to untold riches and ancient artifacts. Legend speaks of a celestial event, a rare alignment of the stars known only to those initiated in the secrets of celestial navigation. And it is upon this event that the tapestry's true purpose is revealed—a guide to unlocking the location of the hidden chest, and the treasures that lie within. So it is that the tapestry serves as both a clue and a challenge, a tantalizing glimpse into the mysteries of the cosmos. And as the stars wheel overhead and the celestial dance unfolds, the key to unlocking Risdoni's secret awaits those brave enough to follow the path laid out before them."
